Whatever product you have, get 20 customers, whatever, literally build a spreadsheet, do that lean startup, prove it to yourself, and then you sell the shit out of that story and you walk into an investor's office, angel, whatever, get your introductions and you walk in there like you own the world. In the Women Who Code Career Nav segment of our show, you'll hear real world advice from people who are currently working in the technology industry and personally know the steps needed to succeed. These talks will include both career advice as well as a look at the industry itself and its practices. So we have with us here today Sharia Sigala and Claire Schmidt, both very accomplished ladies and I think you're going to get to know them and their businesses a bit more today. So Sharia has scaled two tech companies from the ground up. At HoneyBook, she grew the company from 120 employees and 70 million in venture funding. Now as the CEO of Kinside, she's gone through Y Combinator and raised 4 million from Initialize and other elite investors. She notes that as a first-gen immigrant and collegegoer, she has a unique lens on playing and thriving in a traditionally white man's club. Claire is also extraordinarily accomplished, the founder and CEO of All Voices, a reporting and communication tool that enables employees to speak up safely about workplace issues. Before founding All Voices, Claire served as VP of tech and innovation at 20th Century Fox and led social impact at Thrive Market. The list of her accomplishments goes on. I think we'll use that as sort of a launching point for our conversation today. And my name is Naomi Freeman. I'm going to be just moderating the chat. I'm a Women Who Code Leadership Fellow and I'm really excited to see how this goes. So my first question for both of you is sort of, you've got businesses and they're doing a great job and it's amazing. You're kind of, you know, at the top of your game. How do you make an idea or like get started? Like what was step one where you were suddenly like, you know, today's the day I want to X. So maybe you could tell us a little bit more about your business and kind of where that idea came from. Sure. Shadia, do you want to go first or you want me to? All righty, let's go since you're throwing me in there. So first, hi everyone. Thank you so much for having me. For full disclosure, Claire and I know each other for a while back and I'm also an advisor in her company All Voices. And so I'm a huge fan and I've seen this company grow tremendously. So the interesting thing is I'm going to say one thing for the both of us. We are not traditional tech founders, but then I'll bring it back to me. So I'm, as Naomi mentioned, I'm a first gen Latina. I was born in Mexico. I came here, grew up in the US, you know, poor. And so I just want to say like there is no one path to have, you know, being at the top of your career as Naomi said in tech. But of course, I also want to acknowledge that there is a lot of privilege in that I and I think Claire and I have, which is we have pedigree backgrounds who went to Ivy League schools and we have incredible networks. But all that is to say is that there's no one path and really no one moment that one decides I'm going to be the tech founder of a venture backed company. That's obvious. But the moment of like when you realize that you want to start something new, you know, this is so Kinside is my second tech company. Naomi, you asked me to just briefly introduce what Kinside is. Kinside is a childcare app for working parents. I'm a mother of two. So add that to the cauldron in the mix of non-traditional tech CEO. And when I was founding my first company, HoneyBook, which is a really late stage, awesome venture backed company, I became a mom. And so like so many things that we all choose to invest our time and it usually comes from a need that we have or a spark that we have in our personal lives. And for me, it was having a career as a tech founder one time, going off having a baby which is for me experiencing the most universally leveling thing of all life, which is going into parenthood. We're all the same, right? Like no one's prepared. Everything's hard. Postpartum gets you one where like a mic at you might not get you doesn't matter what station in life you are. And so for me that that ultimate leveling. I thought, oh my gosh, if this experience is incredibly hard for me, literally finding a child care, a daycare or a nanny to leave my child, my newborn, right? Because also like we are leaving newborns in the hands of others was incredibly difficult. So for me, I looked at how we could support employees in the organization in their working parenthood status and specifically in child care. And when I went out to look for a product in the marketplace, you know, basically a child care benefit, like an employee benefit, I found that there was really nothing out there available in the modern sense. So that for me was a spark for them launching Kinside. That's awesome. I love to hear your story, Shadia, because I think it's just so inspiring for you to have been in, you know, we're the same age and you've already been through this now twice. So super impressive to hear about kind of where you started and all the things that you've done. And one of the reasons that I wanted Shadia as my advisor is that she was actually the chief people officer at HoneyBook. So she was thinking every day about how to make work work for people. So it's one of the reasons you're so qualified to be an advisor to us and also to start this company. So I just wanted to give you a little bit of that out there. So my background is also non-traditional. I never expected to start a tech company. I started my career in management consulting and then I went into the nonprofit world and I actually spent five years working with Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, helping them build tech tools to combat child sex trafficking. So yes, there is a tech component to it, but it was really a tech product organization. But I was in nonprofit pretty happily and I kind of thought I would stay there forever. But what I really realized over the course of my career, some of which Naomi spoke about, is that I actually was like solving problems. I like identifying issues, identifying spaces where there are problems to be solved and then kind of going in and figuring out what the solution is. And so that's been a thread that's been consistent throughout my career. And I was a vice president at Fox. My title was VP of Technology and Innovation and it was doing exactly that, finding problems and sort of broken systems within the Fox ecosystem. I worked for the CIO and trying to get a sense of how could we structure this better? How could we create a different process here? And I was also on the Fox Culture Committee. So I was thinking a lot about the Fox culture and how the culture of the company could be improved. I think Fox, like many legacy studios, was starting to feel competition from Netflix and Amazon and these newer entrants into the space. And so they were trying to think through, what's our data strategy? How do we leverage new technologies like blockchain and AI? And so that was a lot of what I was tasked with doing. And while I was at Fox, kind of thinking every day about how to fix old systems, I read Susan Fowler's blog post about her experience at Uber. And it really struck me, I don't know how many of you were able to read it or just heard about kind of the fallout afterward. But what really struck me is that we as a society are asking people in relatively vulnerable situations to kind of risk their careers in order to speak up about harassment, bias, mistreatment, bullying, these challenging situations they're experiencing in the workplace. We're just hoping they come forward. We don't give them any promise of what's going to happen next. We say, you just have to come talk to somebody and we'll figure out what to do. A lot of people end up being retaliated against, losing their jobs, being pushed out in some way. And so when I read Susan's story, which is really a story of bravery, I felt like we shouldn't be asking people to be brave in those situations. We should give them tools or processes or systems that enable them to speak up very easily in order to have their problems solved. And I kind of did a landscape analysis. And during this time, I actually talked to Shadia about like, what's out there? What could help streamline those processes and make it easier for employees to speak up and for companies to get information about really toxic things that are happening in their cultures every day? And there are some tools out there, right? There's culture surveys on one end of the spectrum. There's whistleblower hotlines on the other end of the spectrum. But it didn't seem like there was anything that people are actively using to speak up on a regular basis to their company leadership about culture issues, bias, mistreatment, anything ranging from the kind of most subtle, like microaggressions all the way up to severe sexual harassment. So while I was at Fox, I started doing this research. I talked to a lot of people and realized there was really an opportunity to build something unique in this space. And that's how All Voices was born. That's really extraordinary. It's a really extraordinary, I guess, timeline, like how these things move forward and how we sort of crystallize from having this conversation with the folks around us into moving forward into products and into businesses. So for you, and I'll post this sort of to Shadia afterwards, are you selling this product directly to HR or who are you selling that to? What's that model kind of like? And then following Claire, Shadia, once she's finished, can you talk a little bit about unique challenges sort of in this space related to these kinds of products? Yeah, so Claire and I have a shared audience member and that is HR professionals and HR teams because they are the ones who are thinking about both culture issues as well as benefits. And so Kinsight is distributed into companies as an employee benefit. So you can't go and find Kinsight today and log in. You have to be a participant in one of the companies that we partner with. And I want to say that that was very intentional because for us as a mission-based company, we actually believe that the employer-based system needs to be included in the conversation of child care because currently the equation is completely broken. The entire burden of child care rests on the shoulders of parents and the child care providers. Parents are spending between 20 and 30 percent of their household income on child care and care, which is like we're broke. And child care providers also can hardly make a living, right? And yet we're all putting our kids in child care so we can go to work. And so a lot of the utility extracted from employees goes to the employer-based system. And I'm not trying to vilify, but I just want to make a distinction. I don't mean to vilify the employer-based system or capitalism. It's awesome, what have you. But the value chain is broken. And of course, I'm not even mentioning the role of government, which really should be the umbrella stakeholder here. But having said that, for us it was really important that we mobilize the employer-based system to help us make sense and normalize the child care industry and also really distribute the burden a little more equally. So it is distributed via HR. I will say, though, for those of you listening, a lot of folks reach out to me and probably to Claire asking like, how do we sell to HR? How do you break into that? How do you do that successfully? Claire, as a company's incredible at selling direct to employer, our model is a bit different. We actually go through benefits, wholesalers and bigger distribution systems, which is a conversation maybe for another point in time. But just know that there is a layer above the direct to HR. And that's what we're working on, on the more business development top layer. Yeah, I'll just add to that. So we do sell the tool into HR, just like Shadia mentioned. And that has gone pretty well for us. We have some great customers. Go pro. You have a ton of great customers. Instacart, Electronic Arts. So we have some great customers, many of whom have been our customers for years now. And we're starting to see the sort of incremental benefit over time to having this data and having an understanding of patterns and trends related to their culture. But the other thing I'll say is when we first started wanting to start this company, we were like, what about all the people who experience challenging things in the workplace, but aren't an actual employee? So this could be like contractors, freelancers. If you think about like actors on a movie set, there's so many people who are working but don't have that typical relationship with HR that we think of when we talk about, you know, the workplace and HR. And so we decided early on that we're not going to make money on this other aspect of our business. But it's just something really important to fulfilling our social mission, which is that we wanted to have a tool that was available to anyone. And so in addition to the paid customers that we have on the B2B side, we also have a public website, which you can go to right now. It's allvoices.co. And we're working on getting the dot com. And basically, you can select the company that you want to submit a report to. It can be a report about any topic ranging from like harassment to safety issues to culture. Or it could be that you just have feedback. Maybe you quit a company and you really want them to know something about your experience there. But in any case, you go to our site, you fill out a few structured questions, you give us the email address of the person that you want us to share it with, and we will pass that along for you. You'll be kept totally anonymous. And we'll follow up with you to let you know if that person at that company has actually responded to you and you can engage in a back and forth anonymous conversation if you want to. That's really great. I think it's really important that you're covering all those aspects because I think it is true that often HR is sometimes stopping at the line with just employees proper. One thing I'm curious about as we kind of have moved into this interesting time this year in 2020 with COVID and other major events occurring, how is that, you know, are you finding there's an impact on business, positive or negative? Because I could see how it could go either way, given the types of apps. And you know, for each of you, what's kind of the largest challenge there and like the biggest opportunity kind of moving forward? Yeah, so it's interesting. COVID has actually caused the usage of our tool to increase. So we saw doubling in the number of reports from February of this year when COVID was not really a thing in the US to March of this year. So we saw that immediate spike. I think, you know, my hypothesis that that's for a number of reasons. One, we're in a really challenging job market now. And so people are even more concerned about the risks of speaking up about, you know, what's happening with them in the workplace, whatever that might be. They don't they definitely don't want to lose their jobs right now, because it's not a good time to lose your job. They have probably more anxieties than ever. And those anxieties can fall into different categories ranging from, you know, I'm dealing with childcare at my house now, and I'm trying to remote work, and it's not going well, and I need more support in some way for my company or more accommodations, all the way to I'm going into, you know, workplace every day, because I'm considered an essential worker, and I don't necessarily have the equipment I need, or people aren't following the safety regulations. So I just think like, whenever there's anxieties combined with more fear, there's going to be more usage of the tool. And then in recent days, so we have a diversity, equity and inclusion module in our tool. And so we've seen how this movement has just taken over public consciousness right now, which I think is extraordinary. And employees have opinions about how their company should move forward, how their company should respond, both publicly and internally. And so we're seeing tons of reports about that, in particular over the past few weeks. So I think what's interesting to me is like this tool can be, it's so flexible that it can be used for whatever is going on, there's going to be the next thing and the next thing. And the tool is just there for whatever employees are dealing with in real time. And I think that's one of the values of having it. Claire, that's actually super, super interesting. It's a tool is really a means to the end, right? And so I love that you think about that was like a tool helps you to get to whatever construction you need to do or whatever you need to achieve. So yeah, so similar. So like everyone's been impacted by COVID, our business included things, you know, the pace changed dramatically for us in terms of our customer usage, because we like what we do is we connect parents with childcare centers, the childcare centers are closed. So we're not connecting parents to them. So that was just, that's a given. We couldn't get around that. However, because we sell them to the into employers, guess who's super worried about their employees coming back or not coming back because childcare centers are closed because they won't be reopening that's employer. So as so in fact, you know, the I mean, the silver lining behind this is that is that is that at a higher level, the consciousness around childcare as an essential need for our employees has been heightened. And so we've actually seen a lot more movement, press, sales meetings, and deals than we ever have. Because again, you know, I think what COVID exposed was just how fragile the childcare infrastructure is in the United States. You know, you see children running around Zoom all day long as we all shelter in place, whether you're frontline, whether you're, you know, on the customer support team, or you're a senior leader in your company, the child's running around Zoom. And so this was just an ultimate equalizer. And I think it really brought to the surface that employers that they don't need a care in their hearts, like out of the kindness of their hearts, they actually need a care from from a bottom line perspective, because it has impact impacted productivity. And we predict in a very doomsday way, that there is going to be a second childcare crisis wave that's going to hit us. And the next three to six months, as employers are ramping up their engines again, and the days are stuck without childcare, because a lot of the centers and the daycares have gone out of business. And so there's going to be a huge, so for us, that's what coming in. To help appropriately rebalance the market. Yeah, that's, that's a really interesting point. And from my own perspective, just watching conversations and talking to senior engineer friends and things, I think men have realized in a bigger way, that children are everyone's responsibility, and that everyone at home is desk. So I mean, that's, I think it's just interesting across the board, kind of how the consciousness is shifting around that, given the current circumstances. But you've both mentioned, you're, you're both moms, and running these these companies. So outside of COVID, just, you know, in a really brief way. You know, how does that sort of add to your experience, professionally? And how does it sort of, you know, create some interesting challenges that you didn't anticipate? I can start. I mean, so I have a seven month old. And I guess outside of COVID, it's hard to separate from COVID, because, you know, we had childcare from the very beginning. And now, you know, we don't have childcare. And so I'm currently living with my parents and having my parents watch my child and my husband and I live with my parents. I haven't lived with my parents, you know, since I was 18. So luckily, I don't need to be physically in LA right now, which is where my company is. So it's definitely like, your business is your baby, and your baby is your baby. And it's a very different relationship, obviously, you have with each of them. But you really have to take care of and protect both. Like I, I'm, this is not something that I recommend, but like, I didn't take maternity leave because I was in the middle of fundraising. And so sometimes as a founder, as a female founder, and someone who has a baby, like you don't have the same kind of experience that you might have when you're in a mature company and you have, you know, three months or four months of parental leave. And while it's something I would really encourage for my employees to take, I just chose not to take it because of kind of where we are as a company. And so I think it's always a question of balance. It's always like, I end up doing a lot of work in the evenings when she's asleep. But I love my job and I love my kid. And so I'm willing to do it and happy to do it. I don't know if that answers your question, but that's kind of how I've been navigating it so far. Yeah. Yeah. So Claire, I would like to ditto everything that you just said. It's hard, like all the things, but I think, I think I've in the audience, I'm actually going to say something that is maybe you don't hear often. And I, so I tell Claire this all the time and I feel like I have to be like the public spokesperson of this. For me, because I'm a mother of two kids, five, they're five and two. And because when, when I was founding Kinside, I just had my second newborn, literally breastfeeding through white culminator, it was important that I get paid. And I just want to say like, there is no shame in that game. Like I had a family, I had a responsibility, I had a mortgage. And so I absolutely needed to pay myself and I needed to have very structured working hours. And then I was very off, off my working hours. And so I afforded myself the, I had the privilege, first of all, if you're founder, you have the privilege of doing whatever you want to do. Now the circumstances might limit that you might not have funding, you might not have revenue, but just remember there are no rules and everything you read on blog posts is arbitrary. Like oh, founders do this. You're supposed to work 100 hour weeks. You're supposed to not pay yourself. That is all arbitrary. And by the way, all that was written by the man's playbook, like, like, like young white programmer guy. So I paid myself from the beginning, which means I had to get funding. And even, even when I only had a little bit of funding from white combinator, I think they give you 150 grand. I paid myself something. And then when I got seed funding, I paid myself more and I paid myself a livable salary. The second thing is, yeah, I don't, I don't work in the evenings. Oops, there I said it, right? Like I, I just like also just cause I'm so tired and I'm exhausted. And so my nine to five is like intense and that's also okay. Right? And I also like I have some years professionally under my belt. This is my second startup. So I kind of maybe have a little bit of that privilege of having shortcuts built in. And so I am very selfish, if you will, about my resources, time and money. And I just wanted to say that to everyone. And I think it's so inspirational and you don't hear it often. And I have many conversations with Shadia about like, now that I raised my seed around, can I give myself a little raise? And she's like, of course, like, are you kidding me? So she, she's one of the rare people in this space who is very honest. And so I have to give it. Yeah, no, I really appreciate that. And I mean, I have, I have founded, co-founded a company and had it at a certain stage and took it into the Valley. And as a younger person with less experience, for sure, there were many things that I wasn't sure what the right answer was. And like you're saying, these dudes have kind of written the playbook. So I really appreciate both of you having the honesty and transparency right now to just, you know, say these sorts of things in this space. So I guess the other question I have is kind of more on the business side of things is around finding support and help raising funds. You know, maybe you can just let us know a little bit about how that starts. Like there's, you know, these conversations is like, oh, the first million is the hardest. So I guess I'm kind of interested in that space, how you get going, especially given, as you've said, you have non-traditional backgrounds, working moms, non-technical. How did you kind of like begin to navigate this space? Yeah. Now you want to go? Sure. My advice is very short because we have such a short time and I can't even and like, it's hard to fund. So everyone says it's hard to fund, it is, but here's what I would say, practically speaking, whatever product you have, get 20 customers, whatever, literally build a spreadsheet, do that lean startup, prove it to yourself. And then you sell the shit out of that story and you walk into an investor's office, angel, whatever, get your introductions and you walk in there like you own the world. And you just tell that narrative. You're like, Hey, what are you talking about? Like I just got started and then it left. I got started four weeks ago. I just got 20 signups overnight. This is what's happening. Like this is going to happen with or without you. Do you want to be on it? Right. So I just like, it is, I know it's easier said than done, but like, like actually show that you can execute and you have swagger and you walk in there with confidence. Those are the three things that I would suggest. And I know that the fundraising cycle is, is more complex than that. But if you're starting from the beginning, you're like, how do I get my first $50,000 or how do I get my first million? It really is like, it's just a matter of like, whatever you have is good enough. Plus when you, when you deal with storytelling and confidence, that's exactly what guys do. Guys do paper napkin deals all the time. Oh, it was doing drinks and then they gave me a million dollars. That shit happens. So believe that you can make it happen too. That's so good. I almost don't want to add to that because Shadia has given me advice throughout my fundraising journey. The one thing I'll say is I actually found, maybe this will help somebody. I actually found the first fundraise to be easier because you're just selling an idea. Right? So the first fundraise that I did, I had a concept, I had a PDF mockup of what the tool would look like and that was it. And so it had to be people who are on board with the vision and were okay with the fact that there was no traction yet because I needed the money to build the product. Then when you raise your next round, you're being judged on everything you've done between that first raise and then, and everybody has a different idea of what you should have done. And I would just say to Shadia's point, be confident, tell the story, however you want to tell it. Make them, let them know basically that you're going to be moving forward regardless and that you would love to have them involved, but you also don't need them. And I think storytelling is probably the most important thing even in that second round because you're shaping that data that you have into a story. That's right. Yeah. Whatever you can take whatever data you have and make it sound exciting. That is your job as CEO and as fundraiser. The other point that I'm picking up from Claire's kind of reflects on some of what we were hearing in the keynote earlier too about knowing your worth or at least putting up one of those cardboard box fronts like absolutely with or without you, I'm doing this. And we heard a little bit about that in general in negotiating and signing contracts earlier. And I know for the keynote, a big lead was moving from, oh, wow, the company's done me a favor to, hey, I've got some stuff to offer. And let's talk about this. And I hear some of that coming from what you're saying. So we're almost out of time, which is very sad because I've really enjoyed talking to you both. Is there anything else you want to quickly touch on before we wrap up here? You know, I just one thing because I find that when people share the actual stories, they're just gold because they just stick in there. And I went into Y Combinator, it was pre anything. And they were into the concept. It was like the market's right. There's customer base. We got it. But they were like, well, why are you here right now? Why Combinator? Where's your traction? Why don't you come back next batch with more? And I literally said to them, because I'm probably not going to need you then. I will have already fundraised and the train will be too late for you. And that was it. It was them. So it's real. Thank you so much. I really appreciate you both coming today. It's been a really enlightening chat. And I know we've had a lot of kudos and applause from the chat in the session here. Folks have really enjoyed it. I can just say for everyone from here, you can probably check out the networking tab on the side and then jump back into the sessions tab for the next sessions, which are running a little close to time. Some are running about five minutes over. But feel free to jump into the networking tab. And what you can do is click and then it'll kind of like shake you up in a imaginary box and match you with someone else in this Women Who Code event so that you can meet and chat about yourselves, about your work, about the sessions. So thank you and thank both of you. Thank you everybody for tuning in. Yeah, thank you. This was so fun. You can reach out at shadi at kinside. I'm always open for questions. And I'm here.
